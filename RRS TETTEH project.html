  <!--History of the folktale-->
  <p><h1>ANANSESEM "ANANSE STORIES"</h1></p>
  <P>Ananse (a-NAHN-seh) the Trickster is a spider who comes from the folktales of the Akan people of Ghana (West-Africa).  
    The word ananse means ‘spider’ in Akan languages.  
    The stories make up an entirely oral tradition that has been passed down for generations. 
    Ananse stories play an important role in the upbringing of many Ghanaian children,
    as elders use these stories to pass on knowledge to children.
  </P>
  <P> Although Ananse is usually portrayed as a trickster, he may be depicted in many ways.  
    The essence of the stories highlights the complexities of life, 
    while at the same time challenging listeners to strive to be the best they can be.  
    In Ghana, he is also known as Kwaku (kway-koo) Ananse.  
    In the Akan culture, Kwaku is the first name given to a male born on Wednesday.  
    So Kwaku Ananse's name means Wednesday-born Spider!

<!--end of photo-->
<p>This is a very old story told when the world was young . 
  It is about how Mr. Ananse the Sly and greedy one among all the animals in the forest 
  outsmarted himself.
</p>
<p>One day Kweku Ananse collected all the wisdom in the world and decided to keep it all in a large pot for himself. 
  Now he said, “I have all the wisdom of the world for myself. 
  At least that was what he thought being such a greedy person.”
</p>

<!end of photo>
<p>Kweku Ananse then tied the pot of wisdom around his neck with a strong vine rope and let the pot hang in front of him. 
  But then he was afraid that someone would find the pot of wisdom and steal it. 
  What shall I do with my pot of wisdom? He thought and thought and at last he said, 
  “I shall hide the pot on top of the tallest tree in the forest.” 
  So he searched the forest until he found the tallest tree which happened to be the thorny silk cotton tree 
  and brought the pot of wisdom to the tree.
  </p>
  <p>
    While Ananse was trying to climb the thorny silk cotton tree, his son was watching him. 
    Father, he said, "What are you doing?" "Well" said Ananse , “I have in this clay pot all the wisdom of the world 
    and I am going to hang it on the top of the tallest tree away from everybody, 
    then I will be the wisest in the whole wide world." "I have an idea." 
    said his son” Why not hang the pot behind you instead of in front of you. 
    Then you will be able to climb the tree. Well the sly one, Ananse hung the pot behind him and to his surprise; 
    he was able to climb to the top of the tree with his pot.

<p>
  Finally Ananse sat on a branch of the tree holding the pot of wisdom. 
  I thought I had all the wisdom in the world, He thought to himself.
</p>
<p>I thought I had it all in my pot but my own son has wisdom not in my pot. 
  Then he made a statement that we still use today. 
  No one-person can have all the wisdom in the world. 
  On his way down he dropped the pot and it smashed into many pieces 
  and scatted all the wisdom all over the world. 
  That is why wisdom is common among humans today in the world.
