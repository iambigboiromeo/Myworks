<h1>HOW TO PREPARE GARI SOAKINGS</h1>
  <p>Gari can be eaten with very little preparations as it is sold already cooked. It is a grainy  fibrous carbohydrate that is made from dry frying grated cassava(tapioca) in an aluminium pan till it is fully cooked and it starts yellowing. It is eaten across West Africa and ingenious communities in the Amazon.
Gari is very filling and as a dry fibre it softens and expands with water. This is why it is popular with secondary school boarding students. I love Gari
Soakings because it is the easiest of gari recipes to make and you need less than three minutes preparation time to quench your hungar, all other recipes are eaten coupled with a stew or soup. The water in this recipe can be replaced with other fluids such as milk hence it is called soakings.</p>

<p> After you are done with the preparation methods, your delicious Gari Soakings should be creamy because of the milk in it.
  It should smell good. Its thickness or lightness will depend on the amount of milk and water added. The taste of Gari Soakings is uhmm! so yummie!
